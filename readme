Simplified version of the code that allows to use it for receiving info in android app

It works only for 11K1 group

You can set url with your schedule from the site of the PK

exceptional_symbols are expected to be a student's group / other groups will be deleted from your pocket schedule

PROBLEMS:
1) Wprodofiz doesnt appears in list of subject in (P) week / only in (N)
2) if in the class tuple in (N) part is "L05" or other exceptional symbols -> (P) deletes also and second part of tuple

IDEA: return back to 1.04, and delete elements directly from 'timetable' with delete_unnecessary_stuff()
